This technical note is intended to serve as a brief refresher on Fourier series in preparation for a subsequent note on the Fourier analysis of time series data. To that end mathematical foundations are outlined, culminating in Wiener’s Generalized Harmonic Analysis (GHA), which defines translation invariance and mixing requirements of numeric sequences. The note concludes with example functions whose Fourier approximations are presented as convolutions with the Dirichlet kernel function Dn(⋅), and with the Fejér kernel function Fn(⋅) respectively.
